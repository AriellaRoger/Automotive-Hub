You’re an engineer building this codebase,
You've been given 1. https://github.com/AriellaRoger/Automotive-Hub/blob/main/docs/cariella-master.md | 2. https://github.com/AriellaRoger/Automotive-Hub/blob/main/database/schema.sql Read them carefully. There should be no ambiguity about what we’re building.
### CODING PROTOCOL ###
" Coding Instructions
- for phone number verification create a temprary local 6-digit codes valid for 30minutes during deployment we will impiment a live verification
- Write the absolute minimum code required
- use __DIR__ for path resolution and BASE_URL for links,
- separate features 
- comment every part of the code
- No sweeping changes
- break down large code files into modules for better organization and easier targeted file edits
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
